# Deployment Guide — GIFT Quiz Editor Plus

How to upload and deploy this project as a new Google Forms Add-on from scratch.

---

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Install clasp globally
npm install -g @google/clasp

# Log in to your Google account
clasp login
```

---

## Step 1 — Create a New Apps Script Project

Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com) → **New project**, give it a name (e.g. `GIFT Quiz Editor Plus`).

Copy the **Script ID** from the URL:
`https://script.google.com/home/projects/YOUR_SCRIPT_ID/edit`

---

## Step 2 — Update `.clasp.json`

Edit `.clasp.json` and replace the existing `scriptId` with your new one:

```json
{"scriptId":"YOUR_NEW_SCRIPT_ID"}
```

---

## Step 3 — Update `appsscript.json`

Replace the contents of `appsscript.json` with the following to properly declare it as a Forms add-on:

```json
{
  "timeZone": "America/New_York",
  "dependencies": {},
  "exceptionLogging": "STACKDRIVER",
  "oauthScopes": [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui"
  ],
  "addOns": {
    "common": {
      "name": "GIFT Quiz Editor Plus",
      "logoUrl": "https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/system/2x/quiz_black_48dp.png",
      "homepageTrigger": {
        "runFunction": "onOpen"
      }
    },
    "forms": {
      "onFormOpenTrigger": {
        "runFunction": "onOpen"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Step 4 — Push the Code

```bash
clasp push
```

Confirm with `y` if prompted about `.html` files.

---

## Step 5 — Create a Test Deployment

In the Apps Script editor (script.google.com):

1. Click **Deploy** → **Test deployments**
2. Select **Editor Add-on**
3. Click **Install** — installs it for your account only

---

## Step 6 — Test It in Google Forms

1. Open (or create) a **Google Form**
2. In the top menu: **Extensions** → **GIFT Quiz Editor Plus** → **Open editor**
3. The sidebar should appear

---

## Step 7 (Optional) — Publish to All Users

To share via the Google Workspace Marketplace:

1. Apps Script editor → **Deploy** → **New deployment**
2. Type: **Add-on** → fill in description → **Deploy**
3. Go to **Google Cloud Console** → link the project → configure the **OAuth consent screen**
4. Submit to the **Google Workspace Marketplace** for review

> For personal or team use, Step 5 (Test deployment) is sufficient — no marketplace submission needed.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `clasp push` fails with auth error | Run `clasp login` again |
| Add-on doesn't appear in Extensions menu | Refresh the Google Form after installing the test deployment |
| `appsscript.json` rejected | Ensure `oauthScopes` match what the code actually uses |
| Script quota exceeded | Wait 24h or use a different Google account |
